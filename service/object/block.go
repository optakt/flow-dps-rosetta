// Block contains an array of transactions that occurred at a particular block
// identifier. A hard requirement for blocks returned by Rosetta implementations
// is that they must be unalterable: once a client has requested and received a
// block identified by a specific block identifier, all future calls for that
// same block identifier must return the same block contents.
//
// Examples given of metadata in the Rosetta API documentation are
// `transaction_root` and `difficulty`.
